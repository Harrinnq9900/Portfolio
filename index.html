        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I’m Nya—a storyteller, creative, and extroverted soul who thrives on deep connections and meaningful conversations. As a journalism major with a multimedia communications minor, I’ve found my passion in videography, photography, and social media content creation. Whether I’m managing social media for the College of Health and Human Sciences at UW-Eau Claire, capturing student experiences for the university, or creating travel content for my Instagram, Unbusy Travel, I love telling stories that inspire presence and intentionality. When I’m not working on creative projects, you’ll find me baking, junk journaling, or exploring nature with my dogs, Baxter and Rori. More than anything, I want to create spaces—both physical and digital—that foster authenticity, creativity, and a sense of belonging.</p>
